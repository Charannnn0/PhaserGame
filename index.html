    <h1>My First Phaser Game</h1>
   <!-- Phaser is a popular JavaScript framework to build HTML5 games that run in the browser. It is free, powerful, simple to use, and actively maintained. I believe it's the perfect framework to start making games.

    In this tutorial we will build a game where the player is getting points every time he touches a yellow coin. That's super basic, but it's also a great example to learn how Phaser works.
    Here are all the topics we will cover: scenes, sprites, texts, collisions, and tweens! -->
    <div id="game"></div>
    <p>Use the arrow keys to move around and collect the coins.</p>
